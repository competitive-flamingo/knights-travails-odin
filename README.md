# Knight's Shortest Path Finder

This project provides a JavaScript implementation to find the shortest path for a knight's move on a chessboard. It uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to determine the minimum number of moves required for a knight to travel from a starting position to a target position on an 8x8 chessboard.

## Features

- **BFS Algorithm:** Utilizes Breadth-First Search to guarantee the shortest path.
- **Path Reconstruction:** Not only calculates the number of moves but also provides the exact path taken.
- **Modular Code:** The code is divided into functions for checking move validity, performing the BFS, and reconstructing the path, making it easy to read and maintain.
